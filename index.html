<p>Embedded Photo Booth (Embo) enables you to build your own photobooth from scratch. To this end, we give detailed instructions in both hardware and software setup. In particular, we provide an open source implementation of a sophisticated photobooth software within this github project. The software was designed with the goal of a highly efficient, zero maintenance operation mode.</p>

<p>Embo features a photobooth containing</p>

<ul>
<li>A DSLR camera with a prime lense for optimal picture quality</li>
<li>A 10 inch high resolution tablet that serves as a display for an awesome preview experience</li>
<li>A WiFi router to enable your guests to view the up-to-date photo gallery on their smartphones or tablets</li>
<li>An embedded platform (e.g., Beaglebone Black) running a custom <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">yocto</a>-based Linux operating system that hosts the Embo software</li>
</ul>

<p>The Embo is triggered wirelessly using a remote control for the camera.</p>

<p>In order to achieve high quality pictures, we suggest (and instruct you) to use a background canvas and an indirect flash (for example, a reflective umbrella or a large softbox). We usually use a white background canvas and flash it from behind in order to remove shadows and other imperfections of the canvas. </p>

<a id="embo---internal-technical-design" class="anchor" href="#embo---internal-technical-design" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Embo - Internal Technical Design</h1>

<p><img src="images/embo-technical-design.png" alt="Embo internal technical design"></p>

<p>Our internal technical design is build with three main ideas in mind. Firstly, taking a picture should be as extremely easy for the user. Secondly, the picture should be displayed as fast as possible. And finally, the system should be stable as to ensure zero-maintenance during your social event.</p>

<p>In order to remotely trigger the camera, we use standard off-the-shelf wireless camera triggers that connect the user, the DSLR camera and all flashes required to light the scene. Taking a picture simply requires you to press the button on the remote. Pressing the button instruments the camera to autofocus on the scene before shooting. Depending on the camera, the lens and the scene, this can lead to a slight delay between the button press and the shot of the camera. Therefore, the remotes allow you to first half-press the button in order to autofocus the scene. Then, a full press can be used to instantaneously take a picture, giving you full precise control over the timing of the picture.</p>

<p>We use an embedded platform (Beaglebone Black) to grab the image from the camera. To this end, we connect the platform to the DSLR camera via an USB cable. The platform runs our Embo software that internally uses the <a href="http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/proj/gphoto2/">gphoto2</a> Linux library for grabbing the image from the camera.</p>

<p>In addition to the USB connection from the camera to the platform, we use a connection from the wireless flash trigger to the GPIO ports of the platform. This enables us to instantaneously react on the event of taking a picture and to let Embo display a "please wait" screen before the actual image is downloaded from the camera. The connection uses the pc-sync output of the wireless flash trigger.</p>

<p>The platform is connected to a wireless router using an Ethernet cable. The router spans a wireless network that the tablet computer connects to. This way, the tablet computer can wirelessly access and display the picture that has just been taken. The wireless network is also used in order to let your guests access the current photo gallery using their personal devices.</p>

<p>Finally, we have got additional buttons that are connected to the GPIO ports of the platform. These buttons can be used to trigger special functions. At the moment, Embo allows you to two special functions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reset the photobooth. This delete all pictures in the gallery and reset Embo to show the default front page picture. The reset function is extremely useful for resetting the photobooth after the initial set-up of the photobooth, the canvas and the lighting have been completed. Note that we do not delete the pictures from the SD-card of the camera in order to avoid accidental data loss. </li>
<li>Delete the previously taken picture. This function is useful if guests take an embarrassing picture which they want to remove from the gallery of pictures.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a bit of hardware involved. You have to hide this hardware from the Embo users. To this end, you need to build a container that hosts the camera, the screen (i.e., the tablet copmuter), the wifi router and the embedded board. In order to get a rough impression of the container that you will build, you can download the corresponding <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a> model here: <a href="res/Photobooth-Sketch.skp">Photobooth-Sketch.skp</a>

<p>When it's build, Embo looks like this from the outside:

<p>I used medium-density fiberboard (MDF) wood, 9mm thick, in order build the box. Simple woodscrews are used to affix the boards. Make sure that you pre-drill all holes before you affix the screws in order to avoid splicing the wood. Also, I suggest to countersink the screws in order to avoid that the screw-heads stand out. After the box was build, I painted it with acrylic paint. I diluted the paint with water in order to create a paint that lets you see the vein of the wood of the MDF fiberboard.</p>
