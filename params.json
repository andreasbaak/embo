{"name":"Embo","tagline":"Embedded Photo Booth","body":"# Embo\r\nEmbedded Photo Booth (Embo) enables you to build your own photobooth from scratch. To this end, we give detailed instructions in both hardware and software setup. In particular, we provide an open source implementation of a sophisticated photobooth software within this github project. The software was designed with the goal of a highly efficient, zero maintenance operation mode.\r\n\r\nembo features a photobooth containing\r\n- A DSLR camera with a prime lense for optimal picture quality\r\n- A 10 inch high resolution tablet that serves as a display for an awesome preview experience\r\n- A wifi router to enable your guests to view the up-to-date photo gallery on their smartphones or tablets\r\n- An embedded board (e.g., beaglebone black) running a custom [yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)-based Linux operating system that hosts the photobooth software\r\n\r\nThe Embo is triggered wirelessly using a remote control for the camera.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve high quality pictures, we suggest (and instruct you) to use a background canvas and an indirect flash (for example, a reflective umbrella or a large softbox). We usually use a white background canvas and flash it from behind in order to remove shadows and other imperfections of the canvas. \r\n\r\n# Embo-Hardware\r\nAt first, you need to build a container that hosts the camera, the screen (i.e., the tablet), the wifi router and the embedded board. In order to get a rough impression of the container that you will build, you can download the corresponding [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/) model here: [res/Photobooth-Sketch.skp]\r\n![Snapshot of the Sketchup Model](images/photobooth-sketch.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Embo-Software\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
